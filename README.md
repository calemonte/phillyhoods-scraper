# Philly Hoods Utilities

This is an unstructured collection of Node utilities built to scrape, convert, and OCR image assets and metadata from a legacy website. The various scripts aren't terribly well organized or reusable beyond their intended purpose, but maybe one day they will be. 

## Technologies used

* Node
* Pupeteer (for the scraping)
* Tesseract (for OCR'ing)
* ImageMagick (for image conversion)
* Shell.js (for Node-mediated shell scripting)
* CSV Parser (for writing/processing data from .csv)
