# Philly Hoods Scraper

This is an unstructured collection of Node utilities built to scrape, convert, and process through OCR jpg assets and metadata from a legacy website. It's not terribly well-organized, but maybe one day it will be. 

## Technologies used

* Node
* Pupeteer (for the scraping)
* Tesseract (for OCR'ing)
* ImageMagick (for image conversion)
* Shell.js (for Node-mediated shell scripting)
