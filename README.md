# Philly Hoods Scraper

This is an unstructured collection of Node utilities built to scrape, convert, and process through OCR jpg assets and metadata from a legacy website. It's not terribly well-organized, but maybe one day it will be. 

_Technology used: Node, Pupeteer (for the scraping), Tesseract (for OCR'ing), and ImageMagick (for image conversion)._
